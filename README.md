# Healthcare-DLT-Pipeline-Project
Healthcare DLT Pipeline: An end-to-end Data Engineering project using Databricks and Delta Live Tables (DLT). It reads data from DBFS, processes it incrementally with Delta Lake, and stores outputs in three layers: Bronze (raw data), Silver (validated data), and Gold (aggregated data), enabling efficient analysis of healthcare datasets.
