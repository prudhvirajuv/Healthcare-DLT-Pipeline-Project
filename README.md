# Healthcare-DLT-Pipeline-Project
This project implements an end-to-end Data Engineering solution using **Databricks** and **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** for processing healthcare data. The main objective is to build a robust ETL pipeline that reads data from Databricks File System (DBFS), performs incremental processing using Delta Lake, and stores the output across three layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.
